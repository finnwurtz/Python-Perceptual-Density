# Python-Perceptual-Density
This program lets users apply the framework from the [Perceptual Density](https://finnwurtz.github.io/perceptual.html) project to any [urban area](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/urban-rural/2010-urban-rural.html) in the United States. Data is included for [Seattle, Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle), one of four test case cities included in the project.
